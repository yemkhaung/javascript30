# Javascript30 - 30 projects on Javascript

These repository contains(in near future) 30 Javascript projects to learn and practice core Javascript and its new features included in ES6.

As an everyday goal, I am gonna be developing ONE project each day (with some cheat-days occasionally, LoL)

Special Thanks to [@WesBos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) for awesome video tutorials on Javascript.

Go watch them [here](https://javascript30.com/). It's FREE!!!
