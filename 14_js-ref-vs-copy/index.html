    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    person.phone = 123;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, {phone:123});
    person3.phone = 345;
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person4 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
